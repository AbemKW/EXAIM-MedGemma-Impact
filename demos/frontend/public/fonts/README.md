## Getting Power Grotesk

Power Grotesk is a commercial font. You can purchase it from:
- Power Type Foundry: https://power-type.com/
- Or other font retailers

## Alternative: Using WOFF format

If you have `.woff` files instead of `.woff2`, you can update the file extensions in `app/layout.tsx` or convert them using online tools.

## Fallback

If the font files are not found, the app will fall back to the system font.
