Tutorial: Creating Beautiful Figures for Research Papers
Introduction
This tutorial covers the end-to-end process of transforming raw data into high-quality, publication-ready figures. The process moves away from "default" settings to a highly controlled design workflow using programming languages (Python/Julia) and vector graphics software.

Resources Mentioned:

GitHub Repository: github.com/AndreChurkin/BeautifulFigures (Contains the Python and Julia scripts used below).

Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset (Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor).

The 4-Stage Visualization Process
To structure the workflow, the process is divided into four distinct stages:

Code: Create the base figure using a programming language (Python, MATLAB, R, Julia).

Vector Graphics: Refine the figure using software like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Inkscape.

Placement: Insert the figure into the manuscript (LaTeX/Overleaf or Word).

Iteration: Repeat previous steps if the final look in the manuscript is unsatisfactory.

Stage 1: Coding and Plotting (Python)
The tutorial focuses on Python using the matplotlib library. The goal is to move from a "Not Very Beautiful" default figure to a "Beautiful" figure by tuning specific parameters.

The "Not Very Beautiful" Default Figure
When running a standard script with default parameters (using plt.subplots() and scatter), several problems arise:

Arbitrary Size: Dimensions depend on data, leading to inconsistent figure sizes in the paper.

Low Resolution: Default PNGs are often 640x480 pixels, which look pixelated in print.

Poor Fonts: Defaults (like DejaVu Sans) are often informal; sizes are too small for reading.

Bad Colors: Default Blue/Orange look like Excel; Green/Red can imply "Good/Bad" which may be misleading.

Legend Issues: Overlaps with data; takes up valuable canvas space.

Z-Order: Lines are often plotted on top of data points, obscuring them.

The Step-by-Step Transformation
The tutorial iterates through the code (beautiful_figure_example.py) to fix these issues one by one.

Step 1: Zoom and Plotting Limits
Default libraries try to show everything, often leaving too much white space around the data.

The Fix: Manually calculate a square "box" around the data to zoom in.

Method:

Calculate the Median and Range (Max - Min) for both X and Y data.

Determine a plotting_range (the larger of the two ranges) to ensure a square aspect.

Add a zoom_out factor (e.g., 0.6) to provide a small buffer.

Set limits: Median ± (Plotting Range / 2).

Step 2: Fonts
Family: Switch to a formal, scientific font. The example uses Courier New (monospace), though Times New Roman or Arial are also common.

Size: Set font size to 20 points.

Reasoning: When the figure is placed in a two-column journal format, it will be shrunk. A 20pt font in the source file will appear as roughly 8pt in the final paper, which is the standard minimum for readability in IEEE transactions.

Step 3: Aspect Ratio and Grids
Shape: Force a square figure (figsize=(10,10) and aspect ratio='equal'). This ensures all figures in the paper occupy consistent space.

Grids: Add Major and Minor grids.

Controversy: Some prefer no grids, but they help readers read specific values.

Styling: Keep them subtle.

Major Grid: linewidth=0.75, alpha=0.25 (transparency).

Minor Grid: linewidth=0.25, alpha=0.15.

Step 4: Color Palette
Replace standard colors with a custom, harmonious palette.

Source: Used a "Purple Teal Tones" palette from ColorHex.

Selection: Used two main colors (Purple and Teal) rather than a rainbow. This creates a minimalistic, professional look.

Lines: Changed regression lines to a neutral Gray and used dashed styles for polynomial regressions to distinguish them without using jarring colors.

Step 5: Marker Sizes and Line Widths
Make data the protagonist.

Markers: Increased size (s=90).

Lines: Increased width to 2.6.

Goal: Visible and readable, but not overlapping/cluttered.

Step 6: Z-Order (Layering)
Ensure the most important elements are in front.

Scatter Points: Set zorder=3 (top layer).

Regression Lines: Set zorder=2 (background layer).

Step 7: The Legend
Move the legend outside the plotting area to save space.

Location: upper center.

Anchor: bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1.10) (This places it 10% above the graph).

Format: ncol=4 (spread horizontally), frameon=False (remove the box).

Stage 2: Vector Graphics Refinement (CorelDraw)
Even with perfect code, some adjustments are best done in vector software (CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator, or Inkscape).

Setup:

Export the figure from Python as PDF or SVG.

Import into CorelDraw. Crucial: Select "Import text as text" (not curves) to keep it editable.

Refinements:

Clean up: Delete the invisible white background box that Python adds. Remove any unwanted artifacts.

Annotations: Add arrows or text labels to highlight specific data points (difficult to code programmatically).

Axis Labels: Manually nudge axis labels if they are too far or too close to the axis.

Legend Perfection (The Rectangle Trick):

To ensure perfect spacing in the legend, draw a small "reference rectangle."

Use this rectangle to measure the distance between the marker and the text (e.g., "Setosa").

Use a multiple of that rectangle (e.g., 3x width) to measure the gap between legend entries.

Align everything manually using these guides, then group the legend and center it above the plot.

Export:

Select the figure elements.

Export as PDF (for LaTeX) or SVG/EMF (for Word).

Choose "Selection Only" to avoid exporting the whole page.

Stage 3: Manuscript Integration
Latex (Overleaf)
Format: Use PDF.

Command: \includegraphics.

Outcome: The specific font sizing (20pt scaled down) ensures the text matches the document's body text size (approx 8pt).

Microsoft Word
Problem: Word does not natively support PDF images.

Solution:

Export from CorelDraw/Inkscape as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).

Alternatively, use EMF (Enhanced Metafile).

If you only have a PDF: Use an online converter (PDF to EMF) before inserting into Word.

Result: This maintains crisp, vector-based quality that does not pixelate when zoomed in.

Final Quality Check: The "Column Width" Test
To ensure your figure text will be readable in the final paper:

Open the paper's PDF in CorelDraw/Illustrator.

Draw a rectangle over the text column to measure the exact column width.

Place this rectangle over your figure.

Resize your figure so it fits within this column width.

Check the Font: Select the text in your resized figure. If the software says the font size is less than 8pt, your text is too small. You need to go back to the code and increase the font size (e.g., from 20 to 24).

Conclusion: By moving from default raster (PNG) outputs to tuned vector (PDF/SVG) outputs with custom colors and fonts, you create figures that are not only beautiful but enhance the readability and professionalism of your scientific research.
