    """Structured summary for medical multi-agent reasoning, optimized for physician understanding.
    
    Aligned with SBAR/SOAP documentation standards and XAI-CDSS principles for clinical decision support.
    
    Character limits are evidence-based, grounded in:
    - EHR alert & medication-alert usability research (concise, structured alerts reduce cognitive load)
    - Clinical summarization length choices (15-word limits for patient questions, "few words" for problem lists)
    - XAI explanation length and complexity studies (shorter explanations prevent cognitive overload)
    - Cognitive load & readability in clinical text (less clutter improves performance)
