This video is about creating beautiful figures for research
0:07
papers. We will walk through the whole process of creating highquality figures using popular programming languages like
0:14
Python and Julia. We'll explore how small design
0:20
choices like fonts, colors, and layout can make a big difference.
0:27
Finally, we'll see how these figures look like when placed in real
0:32
[Music]
0:40
manuscripts. Hi everyone, my name is Andre. I'm researcher at Imperial College London. I know you've been
0:46
waiting for a long time for this second tutorial on how to create beautiful figures for research papers. And I'm
0:53
sorry it took me almost 6 months to produce this second video. I was quite busy with my research projects at
0:59
Imperial. But now I'm finally back and I'm making this new tutorial where I
1:05
will show you the whole process of creating beautiful figures starting from coding in programming languages then
1:12
adjusting the figures and then finally placing them in real manuscripts. To share these examples with you, I've
1:18
prepared a GitHub repository called beautiful figures. This is what the repository
1:25
looks like. I described the problem of creating beautiful figures and show one example here. And then I list the
1:33
principles of beautiful figures that we discussed in the previous video. So you can see the link to this tutorial
1:39
here. Then I have two folders with code examples for Julia and Python. And today
1:45
actually we will consider these examples. We will try to create not a very beautiful figure. Then we will tune
1:52
several parameters and create a beautiful figure. And we will also discuss multiple aspects of plotting
1:59
including color schemes, layout etc. So please feel free to check out this
2:05
repository github.com Andre Churkin beautiful figures and hopefully it will
2:10
inspire you to use more parameters when producing figures. And here is an example of a manuscript
2:17
that I created for this video. You may see this is mostly an empty manuscript
2:22
following the ITLE e transactions journal two column template. Then on page two I have here
2:29
two empty figures and our goal for today will be to replace these figures with
2:34
something else with our data visualization. And then we will be able to compare how different figures look
2:41
like in a realistic manuscript. When developing figures today, I will be
2:46
following the design principles that we've discussed in the first part of this tutorial. So, if you haven't
2:52
watched it yet, please click on this link and check it out. By the way, I have an idea of developing a dedicated
2:59
professional course about data visualization and graphics. Such a course may be useful not only for
3:06
creating figures for papers but also for people outside academia for anyone who
3:11
is interested in data visualization. This course will be much more detailed than YouTube videos. It will have
3:18
multiple modules covering theoretical aspects and practical applications. I will also develop homework assignments
3:25
for you and provide some feedback and mentoring. Please let me know in the comments if you are interested in such a
3:32
course and what are the most critical challenges and problems that you would like me to cover. I would really
3:38
appreciate your feedback and I would really like to know your needs and your problems in data visualization. All
Visualisation process
3:44
right. Now let's talk about the process of creating beautiful figures. And to
3:49
make this tutorial more structured, I have divided this process into four stages. And the first stage is to create
3:56
a figure in a programming language. So you have your data set and you need some tool to start plotting it. The simplest
4:03
tool is of course Excel. But we will not cover Excel today because it's not really good for scientific purposes. So
4:10
usually you will need to use some visualization libraries in languages like MATLAB, Python, R, Julia, etc. And
4:19
in these languages, you will need to tune multiple plotting parameters to get the desired outcome. So this is the
4:25
first stage when you just prepare your data in a programming language and you visualize it. Then the second stage
4:32
involves graphics software. The point is that the figure that you just visualized in let's say Python may still be not
4:40
ideal and you may need to tune some parts of it or modify it further to make
4:46
it publication ready. And here we will discuss the use of vector graphics
4:51
software. There are several popular um software like Adobe Illustrator, Coral
4:56
Draw and Inkscape. You may try to use all of them. I would just say that Adobe
5:02
Illustrator and Coral Draw are the most powerful ones and the most userfriendly. But the problem is that they are not
5:09
free and you may need to apply for uh free trial period or maybe you will need
5:15
to buy it. If you don't want to pay for such a graphic software, please use
5:20
Inkscape. I know that it's really popular nowadays among students and it can perform most of the operations, most
5:27
of the adjustments that you may need for your figures. Then stage three is to
5:32
place your figures into a manuscript. let's say in latex overleaf. The point
5:38
is that even if you like your figures produced by a plotting library, they may not look ideal in a realistic journal
5:45
template. Let's say in this uh two column format. Some figures may be reduced in size. Uh the colors may
5:52
change, the readability may be reduced and we need to test all of that. Then
5:58
step four is to repeat. If you don't like how your figure looks like in a real manuscript, then we need to repeat
6:04
the previous steps. We need to maybe change our code to adjust some elements of the figures or maybe we need to
6:12
modify some parts of the figures using vector graphics software. So this is the overall structure of the design process
6:19
that I'm following. I'm coding my figures, visualizing my data, then I use vector graphics software to further
6:26
modify the figure. Then I place it in a real manuscript and then I repeat the process if I don't like the final
Let's start coding
6:32
result. Now let's talk about step number one coding and plotting your data. And I
6:38
believe that this is the most difficult and tricky step of data visualization because you literally have empty file
6:46
and you need to run your code and you need to visualize your data from scratch. And while doing so while
6:52
working with plotting libraries you may tune hundreds of plotting parameters. And this is very confusing because you
6:58
simply don't know which parameters would work better and you may spend days and
7:03
days tuning these plotting parameters to produce an effective data
7:09
visualization. And if you don't tune these parameters as we will see today, your figures may look somewhat ugly and
7:15
ineffective. What are we going to visualize today? I decided to visualize a very famous and simple data called
7:23
iris flower data set. And this data set has three subsets corresponding to three
7:29
flowers. Iris satsa, Iris venica and iris versol. And for each of these
7:35
species, we will be showing the length and width of different parts of the flower as you can see in this picture.
7:43
So that's it. This will be a simple goal for today's video. Let's visualize this data set. Let's create this simple
7:49
figure but let's try to follow all the design principles and let's try to make it beautiful and effective. Now I will
7:57
show you my screen my code editor. We will produce a figure of this data set together and then we will discuss if we
8:04
like it or not. This is my VS code editor and I
8:10
opened here a folder with this code repository called beautiful figures. And
8:15
today we will be coding in Python because I believe that this is the most popular language among students and
8:21
researchers. But I also have some examples in Julia. So if you open this subfolder Python, you may see few
8:28
examples. Beautiful figure example.py and not a very beautiful figure
8:34
example. So let's start with this figure. You can see I have some description here
8:40
explaining why this script is called not a very beautiful figure. And then we
8:45
start visualizing our data. And I believe that this script is quite simple and also self-sufficient which means
8:52
that you don't need any additional data. You may just run this single script and it will produce a figure for you. Let's
8:59
discuss what we see here. We import a few packages. Numpy Mattplot lip. This
9:05
is a visualization plotting library that we will use to produce our figures. And
9:10
then we have this sklearn library. From this library we will use some linear and
9:16
polomial regression functions. And also you can see that I say from data sets
9:22
import load iris. This means that we are loading this famous iris data set and we
9:27
will be visualizing it. You can see below that I am reading this data set. I am assigning some features and targets
9:34
for this data, names of the features etc. Then we select what to visualize. I
9:40
call this X column and Y column. And for example, if you set it to zero and one, you will be visualizing sele length of
9:47
the flowers versus sele width of the flowers. Then I want to show you example
9:52
of few lines of few additional analysis and that's why we will be calling a polomial regression function. And here
9:58
you may select the degree of the polomial to use. So you may select degree 2, three or four. And then the
10:05
sklearn library will do the rest of the calculations for you. And we will be able to visualize our polomial
10:12
regressions. Then remember that we have three flowers stosa versol and
10:18
virginica. And here I say select the data sets to visualize. So let's say that this list data sets to plot will
10:26
have only two flowers. Satossa and Virginia we will visualize only two subsets and that's it our data is ready
10:33
to be visualized and that's why here I say let's create a plot so I'm using this command plt dots subplots and I say
10:41
that this is not a very beautiful plot because we will be using all default parameters we are not adding any
10:48
additional parameters and any customization so here the empty plot is
10:53
created and then we need to add our data And I'm doing this in a loop for each
10:59
data set. So you can see that we are iterating over this list of flowers. I'm
11:05
preparing X data to plot Y data and then I'm using this command scatter and
11:11
giving this dimensions to to produce a scatter plot. Then we calculate the
11:17
linear regression and we add this uh to the plot using the command plot giving
11:23
the range for this linear regression and the estimated values and the same for the polomial regression. We calculate
11:29
the polomial regression and we add it to our plot again using the command plot
11:34
and that's it. Then we add the legend and the simple figure is ready. Now we have to save it and show it. I'm saving
11:42
it here in this format PNG. Remember that this is so-called portable network graphics and this is a raster graphic
11:49
which means that it is not pixel-free. It has some pixels and it doesn't have any vector graphics. And as we discussed
11:56
in the previous tutorial, this is not ideal for publications. But my goal here is to create a not very beautiful
12:02
figure. That's why we will be saving it in PNG. So everything is ready now to create a
12:10
not very beautiful figure using Python's Mattplot lib library. So let's click here on the run button and see what we
12:19
get. Okay. And here is the result. Here is the figure with all default
12:24
parameters. Remember that we literally didn't change any parameters. We just prepared data. We just gave names to the
12:31
data sets and that's it. Now let's discuss if we like this figure. So what do you think? Do we like this figure or
Problems with default figures
12:38
not? Even though I cannot say that this is an ugly or ineffective figure, I
12:44
believe that it has multiple problems and I want to discuss these problems with you. The first problem is the size
12:50
of the figure. The problem is that the size may be arbitrary. It may be random and it may depend on the data that you
12:58
are visualizing. This means that your figures may be stretched differently in
13:03
different dimensions depending on your data sets. And even though it's okay when you are simply visualizing data,
13:09
it's not okay when you are preparing figures for your paper because in your paper all figures should be with similar
13:16
sizes. So if you place them together, they should look similarly. It's it's a little bit ugly when you have figures
13:22
and one figure is smaller than the next one. So we need to control the size of our figures. The next related problem is
13:30
the image resolution. If we are saving this figure as a raster graphics as PNG
13:36
image, its default resolution may be quite low. I have checked that in Python's Mattplot lip library, the
13:43
default resolution is 640 pixels by 480 pixels and this is quite low. If you
13:50
place this figure in this low resolution in your manuscript, it may look ugly and readers may see pixelated figures which
13:58
is not good. So again, we need to control the resolution of our images. Then the next problem is the default
14:05
font. Usually default fonts in plotting libraries are not ideal for academic
14:11
publications. Sometimes we can see fonts like Calibri or in case of Python Deja
14:16
vans. And I don't really like deja vuans. I think it's not formal enough and I would like to use more scientific
14:22
fonts in my publications which means that we will need to control this plotting parameter. Also the font size
14:29
may be too small which will create some visibility and readability problems in a
14:35
manuscript. So we also need to control that and we need to select adequate font sizes for all elements in our figures.
14:42
Similarly we need to control the weight of lines. By default, some lines may be
14:47
too thick or too thin and this may not work well for our visualization task.
14:53
Then we also need to adjust the size of markers in our figures. We need to make
14:59
markers large enough so they are readable and noticeable, but we need to
15:04
keep their size reasonable otherwise they will all overlap and it will be difficult to analyze our data. The next
15:11
major problem are default colors. Usually visualization libraries have
15:16
default color palettes that do not work well for our data. For example, consider this mattplot lip figure. The first data
15:24
set has blue color. Then the next data set has orange color. And then we have green and red colors. First of all, I
15:31
don't like blue and orange because they look like default colors from Excel. But but okay, maybe it's not a major
15:37
problem. But then we have green line and a red line. And if some readers don't know the context, they may think that
15:44
green means good and red means some wrong data or some other problems. And we need to avoid such colors. So usually
15:51
when visualizing data, we need to select our own color scheme and we better select some minimalistic color palettes
15:59
with just a few colors. And we will do this today. There may also be problems with the legend. As in this figure, the
16:06
legend takes excessive space inside the figure and it is overlapping with our data. So what to do? We need to somehow
16:13
optimize it. And if we simply put it outside of the plotting space, outside of the canvas, it will take uh a lot of
16:20
precious space in our paper and it it will look ugly. So some work needs to be done to optimize the placement of our
16:28
legend and the elements that we want to show in the legend. And the last problem that we may face when visualizing data
16:35
is a wrong order of elements. Again, consider this figure. We can see that
16:40
the lines are displayed on top of our data points. Maybe that's okay. But what if the data points are more important
16:47
than the lines? Then you need to place lines at the background. And to do that
16:52
again, we need to change tuning parameters when producing our figure in Python. We have now discussed all the
Tuning the plotting parameters
16:58
problems of this figure and why I don't like this default visualization very much. To improve this figure, we will
17:06
now fine-tune these parameters in my Python script and see step by step how we will overcome these problems and
17:13
produce a beautiful and effective figure. So let's check my script called beautiful figure example.py.
17:21
Okay, so we are back in my code editor and now let's find and open the script
17:27
beautiful figure example.py. In this script, the figure is built with multiple parameters. But
17:34
let's discuss what we see here step by step. Again, we can see that we import the packages, the libraries, then we
17:41
open our Iris data set. We select which columns to visualize, polomial degree,
17:47
etc. Everything is as in the not very beautiful
17:52
example. Then you can see that I have multiple plotting parameters commented out. This is because I switched them off
17:59
for now and we will be including them one by one step by step to see how we
18:04
can improve our figure. So for now we are just creating again a simple figure with default parameters. The only thing
18:11
that I change here is this. I'm saying not just subplots brackets but I say
18:17
subplots and fixed size 10x 10 in brackets. And this command will allow us
18:23
to create a square canvas, a square figure with a resolution of 1,000 pixels
18:29
by 1,000 pixels. So we are improving the resolution a little bit. Then we are
18:34
plotting again in the loop for each of the data sets. For each of the flower we
18:40
have scatter commands and plot commands. then the legend. All of this is
18:46
commented out again. And finally, we are saving our figure. But as I said, PNG
18:51
raster graphics is not ideal for publications. And therefore, we will be also exporting our figures as
18:58
vector-based images using PDF formats and SVG formats, scalable vector
19:04
graphics. I will also create this PNG figure called step. And this will help
19:10
us later to analyze what steps we did to improve our visualization. So first as I
19:16
said most of my parameters customization is switched off commented out for now.
19:22
Now let's just run this script and see what we get. Okay this is the figure. You can
19:29
see that the canvas the figure became squared now. But overall this is almost
19:35
the same figure that we called not a very beautiful one. the same colors and
19:40
the same fonts. Everything is the same. Now, let's try to improve this figure
19:45
step by step. And the first thing that I would like to improve here is our plotting limits, plotting range. So, the
19:52
most important thing here for me are these data points. But we are kind of far away from them. We also see these
19:58
lines. They're quite long. And we see additional space separating the lines from the border of the plotting space.
20:06
And this is not great. This happens because plotting libraries in Python or in any other language, they don't know.
20:13
They simply don't know what you would like to show. They see that you are adding some data points here. But they
20:19
also see data points that form these lines and they try to show everything, all elements at once. But sometimes we
20:26
don't need this. Sometimes we need to see only let's say this part. Maybe we
20:31
just need to see the data points and then the remaining parts of the lines of the regression analysis should be simply
20:37
cut off. So to do this at the end of this script I have this part which I
20:43
call zooming out. Let's uncomment it. First of all I create this new parameter
20:49
zoom out. So far by trial and error I set it to 0.6 and I think this is one of
20:54
the best options for this particular figure. But basically it allows you to manually create the zooming out effect,
21:02
the scaling effect when you want to show your data. Okay, so we created this zoom out. Now let's see what I'm doing. I
21:09
know the data that I want to plot to show the most important data, the data that will be serving as a reference
21:15
point for zooming away from the plot. And in the loop, I create this array all
21:21
data x to plot and all data y to plot. basically horizontal and vertical components of the data points and you
21:28
can see that here in the loop I am extending I am adding all data that we are plotting to this new array of data
21:36
points in the loop. So if we are plotting something and we believe that this is important it should be in the
21:41
figure. I simply added as an extension to this array data x to plot and data y
21:47
to plot. Now what I'm doing later I'm calculating the minimum value of the x
21:52
component and the maximum value. Then I say okay let's compute the median and the range. So basically we want to know
21:59
what is the middle point of our data that we are plotting and what is the whole range of data. Then we do the same
22:06
for the y component. We calculate the minimum value the maximum value median
22:12
right in the middle between min and max and the range. And then I create this new parameter called plotting range. And
22:19
plotting range is the maximum between horizontal plotting range and vertical
22:24
plotting range. So I want to be fair. I want to create the same square plot
22:30
equally zoomed out from the center of our figure. And plus I am adding here this parameter zoomed out. So I am
22:37
extending this plotting range. And basically I'm telling the plotting library that we will be flying further
22:43
away. We will be zooming out from our data set equally in all directions. Now
22:49
everything is computed the plotting range and we can simply set the new plotting limits. And you can see here I
22:55
say set X limit and set Y limit. How are we setting the limits? We know the
23:01
median. So we say median minus plotting range divided by two. And the the maximum the upper limit is X median plus
23:09
plotting range divided by two. So the difference is that here we have minus and here plus. And we do the same for
23:16
the vertical component. Y medium minus plotting range divided by two and y
23:21
median plus plotting range divided by two. This may seem confusing but let me
23:26
just open paint and draw an example for you. So let's say that this is the whole data that we want to plot. What I'm
23:33
doing here, I'm estimating the length of its horizontal component and then the
23:39
maximum length of its vertical component and also I know the median points. So I
23:45
can find where is the center of this data set that we're visualizing and it is somewhere here. Right? Then I
23:52
calculate the maximum plotting range. It is equal to this larger component. I am adding this delta let's say delta which
23:59
I call zoom out and I apply the same plotting range to vertical and
24:04
horizontal components. So I am basically creating a box a square box which is
24:11
equally zoomed out from the center of our data set and this allows me a precise manual control over the plotting
24:18
range. Okay, back to the code. Now we set the limits, we set the zoom out parameter, the new plotting range. Let
24:25
me just call it step one. So we are saving a new figure. And let's run the
24:30
code. Nothing changed in the style of the figure, but we changed the limits.
24:36
And now we are kind of zooming in closer to the data points. And I like how the data looks now. It's easier to analyze.
24:43
We are not too far away from the data sets. Okay. Now let's tune more parameters. Let's go to the beginning of
24:50
the script where I create the figure. And the first thing I would like to change is the font. You may simply set
24:58
the new size of your font in the figure. But there are many more parameters that you may use. For example, here I create
25:05
this command params update. And I'm explicitly saying that the font family
25:10
that I want to use is corer new. To me, this is a more formal, more scientific
25:16
font. I know that this is called a monospace font and some people don't really like it. But again, this is a
25:21
matter of taste. You may use any scientific any formal font that you would like. And then you may set the
25:28
font size for your entire figure or for different elements of the figure. For example, for axes, for ticks, for
25:36
labels, for legend, etc. In this case, I already performed some experiments and I
25:41
know that I should better use font size 20 points in this example. And I know
25:47
this because I will be working in a ITLE e journal template and that template has
25:52
two columns. So our figure will be placed in one of the columns and it will
25:57
be reduced in size. It will not occupy the whole page just half of the page. And then when our figure will be
26:04
reduced the 20 points will be displayed as eight points and eight points is
26:10
exactly what we need because this is the smallest font allowed in IE transaction
26:15
journals. So basically we will be using this small but readable font to make
26:21
annotations in our figure. All right. So we specified the fonts. Now let's go
26:26
here and call this step step number two. And let's run the
26:33
script. Here is the new result. Is the same figure, the same plotting space
26:39
that we selected, but now we see new fonts. And not only it's a new style,
26:44
the corer new font, it's also much much larger than in the previous version with
26:49
default parameters. And as I told you, through trial and error, I know that this font will be readable in my paper.
26:58
Let's continue tuning the parameters. The next thing I would like to check
27:03
here are these commands. Let me uncomment them. What am I doing here?
27:08
First, I set the aspect ratio of this figure to equal. So, I'm trying to create a locked square shape. As I told
27:16
you, it's important to control the size of your figure. So, all figures in one manuscript, they are of the same size
27:22
and they occupy the same space. And before that we set the figure size 10 x
27:28
10. But here I'm also telling that the plotting space the canvas also should be
27:34
equal. Then let's talk about grids. Before that in the default figure there
27:40
were no grids. The space was empty. But we can add some major grids and minor
27:45
grids. Minor grids meaning that there are additional grids placed between the major grids. So basically if we activate
27:52
both we will have a lot of vertical and horizontal lines in our figure. This is
27:57
actually a controversial topic because I know that some people don't like adding major grids and especially minor grids
28:04
to their figures and they believe that this makes your data visualization overly complex and you should simply
28:10
remove all grids and just focus on your data. In my opinion, major grids and
28:16
minor grids sometimes may work well. Sometimes readers may want to explore
28:21
parts of your figure. They may want to zoom in into some parts of your data set and see which exact values they
28:28
correspond to. So I would say that in some visualizations adding major grid
28:33
and minor grid is good. Let's try to keep them in this work. But to keep the
28:38
figure beautiful and professional of course we should not add bold black grid
28:44
lines. We should make them very light and transparent. And for this purpose I set the line width to a small number
28:52
0.75 for major grid and 0.25 for minor grid and also this
28:58
parameter alpha which means transparency. So all these lines not only they are thin they also have very
29:05
light shades of gray because of their alpha transparency parameters. So major grid will have 0.25 transparency and
29:13
minor grids will have alpha of 15%. Now we save the script with these new
29:19
updated parameters. We also export our results as step number three and let's
29:24
run it. This is the result. The difference
29:31
from the previous step is that we have grid lines and even though we have a lot of grid lines, major grids and minor
29:37
grids, we set this alpha parameter and the thickness to very low values. That's why it's not disturbing us. it's not
29:44
interfering with our data and I believe that this kind of grid visualization may
29:50
be quite effective in scientific papers. Let's keep tuning the
29:57
parameters. The next thing I would like to work with are colors. You can see here that I say now let's work with the
30:04
colors and we need to select an interesting and effective color scheme for our visualization. So for this work,
30:11
I found this interesting color palette on my favorite website colorhacks.com.
30:16
Let's check it out. If you use this link, you can see that this is a so-called purple teal tones color
30:23
palette. And it has five colors inside ranging from light purple to dark purple
30:29
to light teal and then dark teal. And I really like these colors. I think they're quite beautiful and
30:36
minimalistic. We have only two distinguishable colors here. But using all these gradients, we can create
30:42
really beautiful figures. And if we need to display more data, we can use some neutral colors like gray and black. So
30:50
this is the color scheme that I like and I will be using it in this project. And how to use these colors? All the hex
30:57
numbers are given here. And if you need red, green, blue components, they are given here. So you need to simply copy
31:04
these values to your Python code. Let's come back to the editor. You can see that I created a
31:11
list here called data set colors. Since I have three flowers, three subsets, I use three colors. And also I would like
31:19
to set the colors of the lines of these markers, the edges of the markers. So
31:24
I'm also assigning slightly darker versions of these colors here. So I created two lists, data set colors and
31:30
data set line colors. And recall that we have some lines regression analysis.
31:36
Before that they were displayed in random colors like green, red, etc. Now
31:41
let's use just one color. Let's say this one, neutral gray. And then when plotting in the
31:47
loop, we need to activate commands that control the color. For example, in the scatter plot, we can say that color for
31:55
this data set equals data set colors plus index.
32:01
Similarly in the regression analysis we use the regression color and here we
32:06
also use the regression color and let's control the style of the lines as well.
32:12
Let's say that if this line is polomial regression the line should be dashed. Okay, I saved the script. Let's
32:20
call this step number four and let's run
32:26
it. This is the new result. I would say that these new colors are much more
32:32
stylish. They are working well together and also the gray lines are more
32:37
minimalistic. Note that we still understand what they mean but we don't use these unnecessarily bright colors
32:44
like red, green and blue etc. So we have only two main colors in this visualization. It becomes more
32:50
minimalistic but very effective and beautiful. Okay, let's keep working on
32:56
the plotting parameters. The next thing I would like to change here is the size of the markers and the
33:02
width of the lines that we use in this visualization. Maybe you noticed that in the previous visualization the markers
33:09
were a little bit small and since we don't have many of them, we can make them a little bit larger. So I'm
33:15
activating this command now. S stands for size and I'm making them larger.
33:20
Size equals 90. Also, we can control the edge colors, line
33:27
width, and we can do the same for the regression lines. Let's put the width to
33:32
2.6. Again, I found this parameter 2.6 through trial and error. So that the
33:38
line is thick enough that it's visible, but not overly thick that it is distracting us from our visualization,
33:45
from our data. Here in the polinomial regression
33:50
we also control the line width setting it similar to the linear regression line also
33:58
2.6. Okay, this is step number five. Let's run the
34:05
code. Now we see that the size of the markers increased indeed and the lines
34:11
become thicker. I think this is almost ready. The visualization is almost perfect because we can clearly see the
34:17
data sets. The colors are working well together and the size of the markers is
34:23
noticeable. It's easily readable and the width of the lines is also okay. So we
34:28
are very close to the end. So what I don't like here, let's think about this. I think that I don't like that the lines
34:36
are placed on top of data. Maybe in this case I would like my scatter data to be
34:41
placed uh as the first layer and then the lines as a background. To control this in Python we need to use this
34:48
command Z order. And this command creates an order of display. So the
34:53
higher the order of a certain element this means that it will be placed in front and if the order is lower this
35:00
element will be placed closer to the background. So for our linear regressions, let's put Z order to
35:08
two. And for the scatter plot for our data points, since I want to place them
35:14
in front, let's put a higher Z order of three. Again, saving the manuscript,
35:20
creating step number six, and running it. This is the figure. It's almost
35:29
identical to the previous version, but now you can see that we controlled the order and now the scatter markers, the
35:36
data points are displayed in front. And I like this in this particular example. Okay, there is one more thing
35:43
missing and this thing is the legend. For now, the legend is switched off.
35:49
Remember that in the original default figure, the legend was a little bit unfortunate. it was taking a lot of
35:55
space and overlapping with our data. So let's see if we can improve
36:00
this. Let me just use one command here to activate the default legend. Here I
36:07
say x dot legend and empty brackets. So no additional parameters. Let's see what
36:12
happens here. Now we see a figure with a default
36:18
legend. And even though the legend is more or less okay, it's not very ugly,
36:24
it still can be improved. First of all, it takes a lot of space here. And if we
36:29
have additional data to plot, this would not simply work because the legend will be overlapping with our data. So it is
36:37
ideal if we place our legend outside of the figure, let's say on top. But we
36:42
need to do this in a smart way. And let me show you which parameters I use to control the legend. So now I am
36:50
switching off a simple legend and activate these settings for a beautiful
36:56
customized legend. So what I'm doing here I'm controlling multiple parameters. I create this list called
37:04
desired order and I change the order of elements that I want to show in the legend. So first I would like to show
37:10
the first data set then second data set and then the lines corresponding to
37:16
regressions and then I'm using this command legend to manually create the
37:22
new legend in my desired order and also I specify its location. The location will be upper center and not only it
37:29
will be in the center I say that it will have a new anchor and it will have this
37:34
new value 1.10. It means that it will be 10% higher than the box than the
37:39
plotting canvas. So it will be outside of the canvas and also I say that the
37:45
structure of the legend should have four columns. So I try to spread my data in the legend horizontally so it's not
37:51
taking a lot of space from the paper. And also I remove the frame. I don't like when we have frames of the legend
37:59
especially if they're placed outside the canvas. Okay, let's save the script and let's
38:05
run it again. Now, this is the final version of
Before and after
38:10
the figure that I want to create today. We can see that the legend is placed on the top of the figure. It's not taking a
38:17
lot of space from the paper. We like the colors. We like the thickness of the lines, the size of the markers. We also
38:23
tuned the fonts, the size of the fonts, the layout. We make the figure square.
38:29
we control the grid lines etc. So I think this is the result that I will be happy with for today for this
38:36
tutorial. Now remember that we were saving our visualization steps here as
38:42
Python step. Now let's just revise the steps that we did and see how we
38:47
gradually improved our figure. So here I open the saved images for you and this
38:53
is Python step zero. the initial figure that we started with the plotting range
38:59
was completely wrong and that's why we set the new plotting range and we get this then we change the font the font
39:07
was too small I should say unacceptably small for a journal paper that's why we increase it and also we change the font
39:15
family then in the next version we make the figure exactly a square with equal
39:20
ratio between X and Y components and we add major grids and minor grids Let's
39:25
compare these two figures. I think that in this case since we don't have a lot of data to plot, minor grids help us to
39:32
visualize data. So I would keep this in this particular
39:38
example. Then the next step, we change the colors. We didn't like the default
39:43
colors. We selected a new interesting color palette. And now we have this minimalistic figure with beautiful
39:50
purple and teal colors and light gray lines.
39:56
At this step, we increased the size of the markers. We increased the width of the lines so that the data is more
40:03
readable and visible. And finally, we placed a beautiful legend on the top of
40:08
our figure so it's not interfering with our data. All right, so that was a long
Vector graphics software
40:15
coding tutorial. We started with a not very beautiful figure with default parameters and then step by step we were
40:23
modifying plotting parameters until we liked the outcome. And now we have quite
40:28
a beautiful figure in PDF format. And of course we can take it and place in our
40:34
manuscript. However, before doing that you may do one more stage, one more step
40:39
where you adjust and improve your figure using vector graphics software. I
40:45
actually plan to make a separate tutorial about the use of vector graphics software for improving figures.
40:52
There are so many things and features to discuss. So we can't do this in this video. But anyway, I will just show you
40:59
how I am using Coral Draw software when improving my visualizations. So now we
41:04
will open the saved the exported figure in Coral Draw. We will play with it a
41:09
little bit. We will improve it. Then we will save it in PDF again. And this final version we will place it in a
41:16
manuscript and compare it with the original default figure. So let's do
41:23
that. All right. So this is my folder of the code repository and we have just
41:28
created this visualization steps and the final beautiful figure python.pdf. Let's open it with coral
41:36
draw. When opening a vector graphics file,
41:42
Coral Draw will ask you how you would like to import the content. For example,
41:48
do you want to convert all text to curves? And here you select no because you want your text to remain text as a
41:54
editable text object. And you also select here this option maintain paragraphs text flow and formatting
42:01
otherwise your figure may fall apart. Okay. So here is our vector graphics figure opened in Coral Draw.
42:08
And as I said, overall I like it. It's very professional, very beautiful to me, but still we can improve it a little
42:15
bit. And also my goal is to show you why you need vector graphics software. So
42:20
just let's make a few simple modifications. First of all, I know that we have this field here. It's white and
42:27
it's taking some additional space from our figure in the paper. Maybe you don't see it, but if I change the color, you
42:33
can see that it is indeed a square canvas placed around the figure. So, I
42:39
can simply click delete and remove it. One more thing why we need vector graphics software is because we can edit
42:46
any part of our figure. Let me just quickly show you what you can do. For example, if you don't like this dot
42:51
here, you can just click delete and remove it. If you would like to change something
42:58
about this part of data, you can select these points and change their color or size or anything else. You can also move
43:06
them or delete them. Please don't use this to manipulate your data to submit some fake research results. But anyway,
43:13
this is a powerful tool to make fine-tuning, fine adjustments to your data. Let's just go back. Anything you
43:21
want to add here that you can't do in Python or programming languages, you can do in Coral Draw, Inkscape or other
43:27
software. For example, maybe you want to make some connections between the data sets, between some points. Maybe you
43:34
want to say that this data point is somehow connected to this
43:39
one. Okay, no problem. We create this blind line. We make it thicker, maybe
43:45
like this. And we make an arrow. And then we can also create some
43:52
description here. And we can add as many additional
43:59
elements and descriptions here as we want. So we can modify, improve, adjust
44:04
all elements of this figure. For now, let's delete this part.
44:10
Another common problem of developing figures is that sometimes the axis description may be incorrect or it may
44:15
be placed too close or too far away from the canvas space. If you want to change this, you simply select all your axis
44:23
description, all these elements and you move them. For example, you can move them a little bit down. We are not doing
44:29
this in this example, but I'm just showing you the capabilities of the vector graphics
44:34
software. Now, the final thing I would like to change here is the legend. Even though we worked a lot on the parameters
44:41
of this legend, it is still located quite far away from the plotting space and I don't like this large distance
44:48
between the description between the marker and let's say this Satossa. So how can we do this? Of course, we can
44:54
simply select this marker and move it here. But if we do this manually for all markers, the distance will be kind of
45:02
arbitrary and again this may be not beautiful. Consider this example. This distance between Satossa and purple is
45:09
large and teal and virginica is not large enough and we would like to make it all equal. So we need some reference
45:16
distance and usually you can take the reference distance from your plot. For example, maybe maybe you want to use
45:23
this as a reference distance, the size of the grid line in your figure or maybe
45:28
you would like to use this reference distance, the distance between the plotting space and the axis.
45:36
whichever you like. This is again the matter of taste and the matter of your design choices. As you can see here,
45:42
this is a tip for developing figures. I am creating here a rectangle just to
45:47
measure some distances and then I can copy this rectangle. I can rotate it,
45:53
copy it again and I can use it as a reference to locate some other elements of the figure.
45:59
For example, if we rotate it and place like this, we can say that this is the distance that we should follow when
46:05
placing the legend. Okay, great. Now, let's use it to place the
46:12
equal distance between the markers and the names of the data sets in our legend. So, how we can do this? Again,
46:18
we copy this rectangle. We copy it
46:24
here and here and here. And now we simply manually
46:31
adjust the positions of the markers. If you want, you can use arrows
46:37
on your keyboard to do that. And we place this steel marker
46:43
with the same distance. And this marker as well. Okay. Now we need distance between
46:52
different entries of the legend. So again let's use our reference distance and let's say that we want to use double
46:58
double of this distance to make the gap between the entries. So I'm pressing control I'm extending this distance you
47:07
know maybe two times or maybe three times let's say three times and this will be the distance between different
47:13
entries of the legend. So you can see how many additional things I created simply to allocate the
47:21
elements of the legend. Okay. So let's put linear regression with the same
47:26
distance as well. Now
47:34
Virginia and now
47:41
STSA. Okay. Now all the elements have similar gaps between the marker and the
47:47
name of the data set and same gaps between different entries. We don't need
47:53
these boxes anymore. Let's just delete all of them. You can, by the way, select them like this using shift or alt on
47:59
your keyboard. Delete and delete this. And
48:07
finally, let's group them. So I say group. Now this is not separate objects anymore but a single group and we need
48:14
to understand where to place this. So let's place it right in the
48:19
center above this canvas. So what I'm doing I'm selecting
48:24
the center of this group and I'm looking for the center here. And you can see now
48:30
it clicked. It says this is the midpoint. Okay great. We found the midpoint. Now let's put it on this
48:37
line like this. Ready? And we don't need this block anymore. So
48:42
let's just delete it. Okay, this is the figure. We made a
48:49
few adjustments. We played with the legend and now I believe it's ready. If you want to change anything else, please
48:55
spend time and improve the figure. But for this tutorial, let's say that it is ready. So what we are doing now, we are
49:02
selecting everything, all elements of this figure and we say export the
49:07
figure. Now I'm selecting I need to select the format. Let's say that we first save it
49:15
as SVG scalable vector graphics. And here I say selected only. Selected only
49:22
means that we will save not the entire page but only these elements only the figure that we
49:29
need. It says that this file already exists because I experimented with this tutorial. I replace
49:37
it ready and let's save it in another format in PDF as well. So let's say
49:43
example for YouTube PDF. Yes, again selected only the format
49:51
and the name is correct and we are replacing the figure that I had before
49:58
that. Ready? Now we have these figures and now let's place them in the manuscript.
Testing figures in LaTeX
50:04
This is the manuscript template that I'm using for this tutorial in latex overleaf. It is following the official
50:10
ITE journal two column style and you can see we have here the first figure called
50:16
not a very beautiful visualization and then figure number two beautiful visualization of the iris flower data
50:22
set. Let's replace these empty gray figures with our new figures.
50:32
So for the first one, you can see that I say include graphics empty figure. We don't need it anymore. Let's replace it
50:38
with our not very beautiful figure python.png. You remember this is the
50:44
raster graphics that we created at the beginning of this tutorial. And now here again we are
50:51
commenting out the empty figure and we are adding this
50:56
example example for YouTube Python. And by the way I should upload this example
51:01
here first. So I am uploading this PDF. Let me show you. I'm selecting this file
51:07
example for YouTube Python. It's asking if I want to
51:13
override. Yes. Ready. And now let's recompile our
51:22
paper. All right. So this is the final outcome of this tutorial. We see two
51:29
figures in one manuscript. On the left figure created in Python's Mattplot lip
51:34
library with all default parameters. And we discussed that this is not the best way of preparing figures for
51:40
manuscripts. Many things are wrong here. The size of the font may be a little bit too small. the colors are not working
51:47
well with data etc. And then on the right the same figure but with multiple
51:52
parameters tuned and then post-processing in Coral Draw where we created this beautiful and very compact
51:59
legend and I believe that now the differences between the figures become obvious. Our new figure with
52:06
customization occupies much larger space and the data is better visible and also
52:12
we use less colors so it is minimalistic but yet effective and readers can easily
52:17
see different data sets and different parts of the figure. When I have time I
52:22
plan to write this manuscript and I plan to publish it and it will complement the
52:27
YouTube videos that I'm doing now and the code repository. So my plan is to
52:32
once again explain all these steps and show how we go from less beautiful figures to more beautiful minimalistic
52:39
and professional figures. And by the way, I will make more tutorials. I plan to add more complex figures, different
52:47
visualization techniques, etc. So together we will complete this manuscript later. As I mentioned, I'm
52:55
sharing all codes in this repository. So here if you click on Python you can see the same thing. You can see this not
53:02
very beautiful figure. Then I discuss which parameters we have changed and we
53:07
get this figure and also I talk about the importance of colors. You can see here the comparison in the manuscript
53:14
etc. I did the same test in Julia. It looks almost the same. The
53:20
only difference is that in Julia when you plot with default parameters you get this figure. It's quite different from
53:27
default mattplot lip but again I think this this visualization has some problems and we need to solve them and
53:35
then when I adjust the parameters I get something like this which resembles our outcome that we got in Python's mplot
53:42
lib. So please feel free to check out this code repository and I hope that
53:48
these examples will inspire you to tune more plotting parameters when developing
Edit your manuscript's PDF
53:55
figures. Before concluding the tutorial, let me show you one more thing to demonstrate the power of Coral Draw and
54:02
other vector graphics software. And this trick is called you can open your own
54:07
paper in this vector graphics software. You can open your own paper and edit it.
54:12
So I just showed you the manuscript that we created and now I'm opening this PDF
54:18
in Coral Draw and we go to page two and we see our figures. We can see that this
54:23
figure indeed is raster image. It has pixels and this figure is of infinite
54:29
quality. It is a scalable graphics. Now why do we need it? We may need it for
54:35
some final checks and some final adjustments for our publications. And I will just show you one tip here how you
54:42
can check that the font size in your figure is readable. For example, here we
54:48
see this figure two. Let's create a text and let's write figure two
54:54
fig.2. And let's say that this this was eight points because I
55:02
know that in the official it journal template this text should be eight points. So now I go here I say that
55:09
let's make this text eight points and let's change it to Times New Roman because this is the font of the journal
55:17
and let's try to compare these two objects. Let's make it green. You can see that they're matching
55:24
because this is the same font and the same size. And then we can we can check
55:29
if the font of our figure is large enough or not. So in this case, it's a
55:35
little bit smaller than eight points, but it's also a different
55:41
font. Now imagine if your figure is very large and you need to analyze the fonts
55:46
that you're using there. You can use Coral Draw to measure the space, the space that you have for plotting. So
55:52
let's create this rectangle here. And we know that our space goes from left to
55:57
right like this. Let's move it here. So this is the width of the column space
56:04
that we have for plotting. And imagine if your figure let me just create a random figure. Imagine if your figure
56:11
looks like this. So you need to adjust your figure to the plotting space. So what you can
56:17
do, you can just take this rectangle. We know that it is exactly of the plotting
56:22
space of the journal template. You put it here and you make it as large as your
56:29
new figure. You make it large like this. Now you click on this text and you
56:35
remember it was eight points. Now you can see that it becomes 10.6 points.
56:41
This means that if working with this new larger figure and placing some fonts there, you need to place fonts of at
56:48
least 10 points so that when the figure is reduced to one column space, it will be reduced like this.
56:54
the font will become eight points. So this is an interesting test, an interesting adjustment that you can do
57:00
to understand which fonts to use in your figures and how big should the elements in your figures be. As I said, there are
57:08
many more features of vector graphics software that we can use to improve our figures, but we will discuss them in the
57:14
future tutorials. And finally, one last thing that I want
Working in Word
57:20
to cover as I promised is what to do if you have to work in word. If you cannot
57:25
work in latex overl then you cannot simply place your PDF images in a word
57:31
file. Let's see what we can do. So this is the same template of the paper but
57:36
now in word. So you can see it's not latex anymore. And we can see here the
57:43
fields for figures. This is just a sample figure provided by
57:48
ITLE E and you can see that it is pixelated and we need to replace it with
57:54
our new figure. So how can we do that? If we click here and we select
58:01
change picture, there will be no option to select a PDF. So Word simply doesn't
58:07
understand the PDF format. We need to select something else. And to do this, we need to save our image in Coral Draw
58:14
as SVG or EMF. So here you can see my folder and
58:20
we are trying to replace this standard figure with our visualization. And you can see that there is no PDF. So as I
58:28
said, Word cannot read PDF files. That's why we need to use some other formats.
58:33
And I already saved this example for YouTube Python in scalable vector graphics. SVG. And if we select this SVG
58:41
and say insert, we get our figure and it will be
58:48
vector-based. Let's make it a little bit
58:53
larger. And let's check that indeed it's a vector-based figure. So for this I
58:59
click on file, export, create
59:04
PDF, and I'm saving this manuscript as a PDF file.
59:14
Now, let's open this PDF that we created in Word. And you can see that indeed
59:19
this figure was pixelated, but this one, our new figure, is vector-based because
59:25
we used SVG format when placing it in Word. And if your Word doesn't
59:31
understand SVG formats, you can use another format called EMF, enhanced metapile.
59:37
You can create emf using coral draw or other software. Or if you don't have any
59:42
software, you just have a beautiful figure in PDF. You can easily convert it
59:47
using some online converters. So simply Google PDF to EMF and you will find some
59:52
converters and you will be able to place your vector-based figure in word without
59:58
loss of quality. All right. So that's it. We have created a beautiful vector-based
Conclusion
1:00:05
figure. We placed it in our manuscript. We adjusted multiple parameters and we also discussed how to modify it using
1:00:12
vector graphics software and what to do if you can't work in latex and you need to place your vector image in a word
1:00:19
format. I published all examples that we considered today in my code repository.
1:00:24
So please feel free to check it out and use these examples and these plotting parameters. I also plan to finalize the
1:00:31
manuscript how to create beautiful figures and publish it online later. Remember that you don't need to repeat
1:00:38
my style. The goal of this tutorial is just to share my experience of how I am
1:00:43
tuning plotting parameters and some additional tips for data visualization. But eventually in your works in your
1:00:50
papers, you will need to develop your own style. When working on your figures, you can now constantly think about all
1:00:57
these plotting parameters that you can further optimize. For example, the plotting range as we discussed how we
1:01:03
can zoom out from our data set, the use of readable fonts, harmonious, good
1:01:08
color schemes, etc. My goal for the next tutorial is to share more complex
1:01:13
examples with you. Today we focused on a rather simple case visualizing a small data set. But in the next tutorials we
1:01:21
can work on more complex and professional problems and use other visualization techniques. So here again
1:01:27
I would appreciate your feedback. Please tell me in the comments which figures you would like me to work on and if you
1:01:32
have any specific visualization problems you would like me to cover. Thank you for being with me through this long
1:01:39
tutorial and I hope that the ideas we discussed today will help you to produce very beautiful figures in your papers.
1:01:46
Thank you and see you soon. Bye.
